Keep on climbing down then so metals can flourish. 

I however would like a bounce to level things out with related tickers but ill take it if we keep running. 

Time for calls on laggards."
"All eyes on $DXY sitting at major support and not breaking down further.

Still needs to clear resistance ($102.26)"
"$DXY still struggling with resistance.

"$DXY doing well consolidating at the recent lows of 103-104. 

2022 saw the dollar index rise significantly assisted by fed monetary policy etc - overlay 10Y real rates.

2023 Q1/Q2 heading into a global recession it remains a safe haven. 

Expectation is that we revisit 1.09s"

Something important to note is $DXY closed back above key monthly swing low at key historical S/R.
why $JPY so strong today
Adding to my silver plays with $dxy not really pumping.
"I do wonder if $DXY can bounce still.

It did just retest the HTF reaccumulation.

We now have some key levels provided by Top Goon X so we'll know exactly how high it can go and the key breakout level.

Can review this on live stream soon."

"The $DXY looks topped

Very conflicting signals given crypto usually bottoms around the same time‚Ä¶"
"$DXY low of session, approaching $108"
"If CPI didn't print bullish today and $DXY didn't dump we would likely have had proper capitulation.

Now the #crypto market is in a wierd spot.

$15B evaporated, trapped shorts, negative funding, market-makers, VCs and institutions wanting to hedge and many likely insolvent"
$DXY below ~$109 is certainly a good start.
@USER #DXY If they close it here or lower it could get nasty. Very distributive since September high. Cloud break in concert with MACD trading into negative territory and a turn lower in the Fisher Transform. Keep Buying commodities

$EURUSD was clean as this morning. I was still at the beach so missed it üòÇ
"When looking at structure you ideally want to observe the weekly for a shift. You also want to mark out the low that lead to the last swing NOT just any low.

$EURUSD back over 1.0
$dxy at the cloud . Need that entry or we bounce.
Top Goon X low time frame buy alerts on $DXY
"I spoke about $DXY putting in a weekly bearish engulfing which indicated a short term top. Coupled with this we had a decent reclaim of the range from $BTC.

$EURUSD had also put in a bullish engulfing just below key resistance. Many pieces to the puzzle that all lined up nicely.
