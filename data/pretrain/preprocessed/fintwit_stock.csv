"20. $DPZ although not a flashy business has some incredible marketing, decent food, and consistent growth.

They have expanded their NI 7 years in a row for a 38% CAGR since 2015. 

A great buy and popular amongst franchisees"
"18. $CMG Although a high valuation, this is a staple amongst zoomers and gym goers.

Has plenty of room for NI growth and steady growth as revenue expands

73.8% CAGR since 2017 and stock split candidate"
"17. $MSFT has been turned around by Nadella

Whopping 83.7% CAGR since 2015 and just prints money hand over fist with Azure

Would not be surprised to see MSFT and GOOGL replaced Apple at the top of the mcap list in coming years"
"16. $ATVI gaming giant possibly being acquired by MSFT

Decent growth potential and a small dividend.

The risk here is if Call of Duty franchise falls off which is fairly possible...

43% CAGR since 2015"
"15. $ISRG medical tech growth name that has essentially establish itself as the leader in non invasive surgery.

Big growth potential and still providing 49% CAGR since 2015"
"14. $ADBE very very underrated SAAS company that has carved out a complete monopoly when it comes to media production.

Still providing a 69% (kek) CAGR since 2016 and will continue to be crucial in the creator economy.

Probably my 3rd favorite buy here."
"13. $NFLX although has went on a terrific run and a terrific plunge, still has incredible growth.

Has become a staple amongst entertainment, has a great CEO, and still providing ample growth opportunities. 

Valuation is not so ridiculous anymore and should perform well"
"12. $TGT struggled the previous few years has turned it around and become a household favorite amongst moms

TGT has a 29% CAGR since 2015 and also offers a 1.6% dividend yield that has been raised for 50+ years in a row.

A good bet on customer loyalty here."
"11. $MRK although sporadic, MRK is a big pharma champion that offers about an 8% CAGR with a 3.5% dividend yield

Great stock for someone who wants to reduce some volatility and provide some income."
"10. $UNH Basically provides health insurance for every corporate workers in America.

This business is protected by ridiculous medical costs in America and continues to show 49.5% CAGR since 2015 and a 1% dividend.

This is my 2nd favorite buy next to GOOGL"
"9. $FB Everybody wants to jump on the fuck zuck bandwagon and say Meta is cooked but the books say otherwise. 

FB is trading at just 5x 2021 profit and revenue still expanding.

Chances are revenue growth slows in the future, but is still grossly undervalued at today's prices."
"8. $ROKU Often remarked as a stock shitcoin, I think this has very high growth potential. They just turned the corner on profitability and revenue is expanding at 60% annually. 

Although they have competition from AAPL and AMZN I think they pull ahead.

Stock can 3x from here."
"7. $NVDA is one of the hottest growth stocks for a reason.

This is one of the most impressive growths I've seen fueled by the rise of PC gaming and crypto, none of which I see disappearing anytime soon.

Although traditionally overvalued, I think growth will cancel out high p/e"
"6. $SBUX Got absolutely crushed by the pandemic and is still trying to shake off head winds

However, they are making good fundamental changes by focusing on expanding drive thru locations and still pay a handsome 2%+ dividend yield

This should recover eventually"
"$V steady growth machine

Although consumer spending is very dependent on economic circumstances, Visa gets paid a few cents for basically 50% of all card related transactions.

As prices go up, so do their profits. Although not as fast growing still a very consistent 10% CAGR"
"4. $COST trades at undeniable premium for a reason 

35% CAGR since 2015 and inflation hedged business. Although Costco has very thin margins which can be a reason of concern, Costco has some of the greatest customer loyalty ever and is building that in Asia."
"3. $HD 

This is one of my top 2 favorite boomer stocks. 39% net income CAGR since 2015. They also have been increasing their dividend by 15% annually (your dividend yield will double every 4.8 years)

Also great business to hedge inflation and overall dad approved."
"2. $AMZN

Too many people are focused on their EPS but EPS doesn't tell the whole story.

Net income still expanding at a 50% CAGR. Could be in for a difficult year as GOOGL has 2x the NI (which tells you how undervalued GOOGL is) but still goes to show company ≠ stock price"
"1. $GOOGL This is the most underrated stock in the whole market right now.

Net income is up 500% since 2015 and nearly doubled from 2020 to 2021.

YouTube is a cash printing machine and advertising online becoming more crucial."

$GBTC is still trading at a massive discount around ~26.3%. Many think this means a 26% return if the fund converts to an ETF but the return is actually much bigger. Eliminating a 26.5% discount would be analogous to a security appreciating to $100 from $73.50 -- a 36% return.

A lot of us are scrolling, reviewing various trendlines, indicators, breadth oscillators, and biases to decipher where this market is headed...
