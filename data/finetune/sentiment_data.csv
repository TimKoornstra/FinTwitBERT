$CRV/BTC 🧐,1
"#SOL  Highest value over the previous 60 days.  Looking good and hoping to keep going toward 240k sats (~20%)  UCTS Buy signals on multiple timeframes, 15%+ since the most recent 2D Buy signal  $SOL",1
Longed #BTC @ $22.1k.  Intra-day 1H trade. Bull flag breakout. Looking to exit above $23k+ or $22.5k rejections.   Risk: $70 | Gain: $200  Trade here: http://u.primexbt.com/omzcharts,1
#BTC above 4H belt for 1st time since $45k  + 4H belt has turned green for 1st time in 7 weeks  LFG,1
"#RUNE is attempting to break above the range that has been established over the past three months.  UCTS indicator is bullish over a variety of timeframes  so I took the 1D Buy as entry   If successful in hodling or flipping this level, the first initial goal is 15k sats $RUNE",1
Huge $ETH break out but $BTC hasn't yet followed  ETH pausing/pulling back here is healthy but will drag BTC down too  Good chance BTC follows with a break out & extension but really wanna see $21.3k hold. Any lower would be worrisome  The game of musical chairs continues,0

$AAPL Very interesting chart. Has now taken the lows 3 times and there's a ton of untapped highs all the way up to $142.  If this starts turning this could become quite the squeeze.,1
"$LUV - If you pay attention to one thing pay attention to #stocks like Southwest. They are doing 3 times the revenue and valued at 50% less. Price artificially pumped as less flew, and WAY overcorrected. Travel going back up, revenue higher than pre-pandemic. #ValueInvesting.",1
"As discussed yesterday,  Weekly + Daily bullish divergences on the S&P500 index ahead of CPI data.  #SPX",1

Got no clear entry on $BTC LTF structure isn’t clean enough for me to take a position.  It’s currently at the area where I said shorts would look to defend. Not trading on the weekend so I’ll be waiting for the weekly close.  Enjoy the weekend. Good to be back 🤝,0
